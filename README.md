# Blog user front-end view
This is the main website that contains the blog posts and is open to the public to view.

## Description
This is a full stack blog built using the MERN stack that uses the REST API back end that I created.
There are three parts to this project, backend, admin frontend and user frontend. This is the user frontend.
Here are the links to the other parts:

admin front-end view: https://github.com/vincephung/blog-frontend-admin

backend view: https://github.com/vincephung/blog

### User Front End Functionality
* The project fetches data from the backend API and displays posts/comments on the webpage.
* Displays only the published posts
* Any person who views the blog can make comments.

## Technologies used
* MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
* HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), JavaScript
